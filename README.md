# 16-bit ALU in Verilog

This project implements a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL.  
It performs basic arithmetic and logic operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, INC, and DEC.

## 💡 Features
- 16-bit input operands (A and B)
- 4-bit control signal to choose operation
- Carry-out and Zero flags
- Fully testbench-verified

## 📁 Files
- `alu_16bit.v`: Main ALU module
- `tb_alu_16bit.v`: Testbench to simulate the ALU operations

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / Vivado / EDA Playground (for simulation)

## 📊 Output
Simulated waveform results for each operation.
